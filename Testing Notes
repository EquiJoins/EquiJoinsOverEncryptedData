Test correctness of inner product function (TODO)
    Modify external python code to use the c++ implementation of the IPF
        Write parser to process results from c++ implementation
        Write code to compare the results or assert that the implementation works with the c++ code
        Note that given the potential overhead of the parser this test will only test the correctness of the implementation
    Write python code to just test the speed of the IPF
        Each ipf carries out N inner product calls
        Note that the python native code will have an inherent advantage
